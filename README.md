# Wk 10 README Updates - Focus on Front End:
- This weeks focus was on the front end aspect of our project  
- We already created an excellent front end with a clear color pallete  
- This week, we focused on updating our weather.html file to match our style guide of our index.html page
- Our future goals for this page are to fix up the CSS and add more color to the page. We also want to add a more appealing color system and animations to the page
